        <h5>This is my Motivation paragraph</h5>
        <p>Walt Disney’s success story was full of painful events and failures.

          When he returned from serving as a Red Cross  volunteer in World War I, he’d had enough time to think about his future. He wanted to make cartoon motion pictures. So in 1920 he started his own company at the age of 19, drawing cartoons of the creatures from his childhood.
          
          At the same time he had so little money to pay the rent, being forced to live with friends and often going without food. He failed to sell a single cartoon.
          
          At the age of 22, he went bankrupt after the brutal failure of a cartoon series in Kansas City. He went bankrupt several times. He also wanted to become a Hollywood actor but it never happened. He was once fired by a newspaper editor who accused him to be lazy and lacking imagination and creative ideas.
          
          Three years later he left Kansas City for Hollywood to pursue his childhood dream. He set up a studio in a converted garage and, after five years – a long time when he is without an income, he struck little success with a short animation of ‘Alice in Cartoonland’ and ‘Oswald the Rabbit’.
          
          But again in 1928 some of his cartoonists left taking Oswald with them. Disney was shattered. His success was short lived and he returned to having nowhere to live and little money for food.
          
          But his secret of success was within him. Out of the disaster he created his first Mickey Mouse character and, suddenly, he was on the road to real success.
          
          Rest is the history…!!!</p></br><p>Walt Disney</p>
